Wolf Man. WOW. Just, I mean... there's fur everywhere, and the moonlight, god, it’s like—it practically slaps you in the face every time you blink. 🐺🌕 The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing, I could barely hear the growls over the annoying crunching of popcorn. There's still some crumbs stuck to my hoodie, great, and my back is killing me from those seats—who designs these torture devices?

> Anyway, what was I saying? Right! The transformation scene, oh man, it was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jekyll drink his potion while riding a roller coaster. Bones 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ling, fur sprouting, I think I sneezed popcorn everywhere at that part and the couple two seats over glared at me like I was the disruptive one. Sorry for breathing? Or sneezing? Whatever. 

Somewhere in the fog of it, I thought about the symbolism of man vs beast, which is like, as old as the hills — exactly like how old those seats felt, I swear they were relics from Ancient Rome. The end though, don't even get me started, my heart's still all jittery, racing faster than that one time I drank three espressos on an empty stomach. Like when the lantern swung and the shadows did their creepy dance, it was basically shadow puppetry but with bonus existential dread.

Did I mention this one part that’s like Chewbacca-meets-Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”? It was like the colors were howling, which is, well I mean, that's just plain weird — but worked weirdly? Real spectacle, tells you what sheer chaos in a lunatic's palette would look like.

Bailey from work mentioned 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the movie, guess there's something to that, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie again real close — wait for when his claws scrape the stone wall, defffff need headphones for that! You actually hear the desperation. Phew! And the time's all jumbled, feels like someone built a collage with stamps from different eras and threw it against the wall until it stuck.

I probably should eat something. Or nap. Or both? God, these late-night showings really mess me up... 

```C++
// Why is this here? 
int main() {
    std::cout << Hello, Wolf Man! << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
